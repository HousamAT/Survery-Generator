# Survey Application
This is a Java based console application that allows users to create, save, and take surveys.
The application supports multiple question types based on user selection. 

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to learn and implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. By developing this survey application, I aimed to deepen my understanding of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance.

### How to Run the Application ###

# Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

# Steps 
1. git clone https://github.com/HousamAT/Survery-Generator.git
2. cd Survey Generator 2
